# dmc: The Drewno Mars Compiler üï∫

This project was created 
during the Fall 2023 offering of [EECS 665: Compiler Construction](https://compilers.cool)
at the University of Kansas as a collaboration between [James Hurd](https://jameshurd.net/),
[Huyen Nguyen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/minhhuyen-nguyen/), and our
instructor (and, much to his chagrin, the project's namesake) 
[Professor Drew Davidson](https://drew.davidson.cool/).

`dmc` is a compiler for the C-like `drewno_mars` language targeting 
x86-64 systems.

Above you'll see several folders, each one representing a different
checkpoint of the project during the semester. To compile and run the
finished compiler, run `make` inside of the `p7_files` folder.

Happy compiling, and thank you Drew for a wonderful semester! üçæ
